# gtfs2graph

The command line application `gtfs2graph` converts a [General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) transit feed](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) into different graph formats.

## Installation

To install `gtfs2graph`, [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) needs to be installed. Then execute:
```
mkdir gtfs2graph && cd gtfs2graph
wget https://github.com/mocnik-science/gtfs2graph/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd gtfs2graph-master
cabal update
cabal install
```

## Usage

Two different types of networks can be constructed:

**Connectivity Network.** The nodes of the connectivity network represent stops and stations of the transit feed, and edges represent pairs of successive stops of the same trip. This network is saved as a GraphML file.

**Shaped Network.** The shaped network represents, in addition to the connectivity network, information about the shape of the connections between the stops and stations. This network is saved as a SVG file.

In case of the connectivity network, the weights can be constructed in several ways:

**Travel Time Weights.** The weights of the edges represent the travel time (the start point in time of the travel is defined as the arithmetic mean of the preceding arrival and the departure of the travel represented by the edge, and the end point as the mean of the arrival and the succeeding departure). When more than one edge is present, the one with the smallest weight is chosen.

**Network distance.** The weights refer to the metric distance that needs to be travelled within the network.

**Distance in space.** The weights refer to the metric distance that needs to be travelled within space, ignoring the network.

In case of the shaped network, the weights can be constructed in two different ways:

**Connection Weights.** The edge weights refer to the number of edges with the same start and end node, i.e. to the number of connections existing between two nodes.

**Travel Time Weights.** The weights of the edges represent the travel time (the start point in time of the travel is defined as the arithmetic mean of the preceding arrival and the departure of the travel represented by the edge, and the end point as the mean of the arrival and the succeeding departure). When more than one edge is present, the one with the smallest weight is chosen.

Dependent on the file format chosen to export the data, different types of networks and different types of weights are available.

The options can be explored by `gtfs2graph -h`:

Most notably, the option `--handle-broken-csv` can be used to handle GTFS data that is broken.

## Export As GraphML

A GTFS transit feed can, as a *connectivity network* with *connection weights*, be exported in the [GraphML format](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) format:
```
gtfs2graph graphml gtfs_dir
```
The parameter `gtfs_dir` refers to the path which contains the transit feed as unpacked txt files.

## Export As SVG

A visualization of a GTFS transit feed can, as a *shaped network* with *travel time weights*, be saved in the [SVG format](http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/):
```
gtfs2graph svg gtfs_dir
```
Alternatively, the also the *connectivity network* with *travel time weights* can be saved:
```
gtfs2graph svg --no-shape gtfs_dir
```
Many options are available to adjust the visualization. The options can be explored by `gtfs2graph -h`.

A generated SVG file can be converted to a PDF file, e.g. by using `svg2pdf` or `cairosvg` available from [Cairo](http://www.cairographics.org):
```
cairosvg file.svg -o file.pdf
```
Alternatively, a generated SVG file can be converted to a PNG (or JPEG) file, e.g. by using `pdftoppm` available from [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org):
```
pdftoppm -png -scale-to-x 1200 -singlefile file.pdf file
```

The colours used in the visualization refer, in case the option `--one-color-per-file` is not used, to the different modes of transport. The first given colour refers to trams, the second one to subways and metros, etc. Compare also the [GTFS documentation](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#routestxt):
```
0 - Tram, Streetcar, Light rail. Any light rail or street level system within a metropolitan area.
1 - Subway, Metro. Any underground rail system within a metropolitan area.
2 - Rail. Used for intercity or long-distance travel.
3 - Bus. Used for short- and long-distance bus routes.
4 - Ferry. Used for short- and long-distance boat service.
5 - Cable car. Used for street-level cable cars where the cable runs beneath the car.
6 - Gondola, Suspended cable car. Typically used for aerial cable cars where the car is suspended from the cable.
7 - Funicular. Any rail system designed for steep inclines.
